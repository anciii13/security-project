# Client and employee information system in a marketing agency

### Security in electronic business systems

This was my first encounter with some intriguing security aspects, which led me to deeply consider all the things that can go wrong, how users can be protected, attacked, or how they can unintentional or malicious cause various issues within our systems.

This application addresses some of the security problems, and the key features I would highlight include:

- Monitoring and surveillance of security-significant events
- Certificate management via PKI services
- User registration and authentication with two-factor authentication (Time-based One Time Password generated by Google Authentificator)
- CAPTCHA test (implementation of Google reCAPTCHA)
- RBAC model for access control
- HTTPS communication
- Encryption of sensitive data in accordance with GDPR guidelines
- Single Sign-On (Google SSO)

### Technologies

In this project, my colleagues and I utilized technologies with which we are most familiar to effectively tackle new security challenges.

- ***Server platform***: Java + Spring Boot

- ***Client platform***: Angular + REST services

- ***Database***: Relational Database (PostgreSQL)

For the server-side (back-end), we employed Java with the Spring Boot framework, while for the client-side (front-end), we used TypeScript, HTML, and CSS within the Angular framework.

Data storage was handled using a relational database (PostgreSQL).

### Getting started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
```
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the backend using Java and Spring Boot
3. Set up the frontend using Angular
4. Configure the database using pgAdmin
```

Please enter the following command in the Command Prompt to run the Angular application with SSL:
```
ng serve --ssl
```
