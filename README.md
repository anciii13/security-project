### Security in Electronic Business Systems

This was my first encounter with some intriguing security aspects, which led me to deeply consider all the things that can go wrong, how users can be protected, attacked, or how they can inadvertently cause various issues within our systems.

This application addresses some of the security problems, and the key features I would highlight include:

- Monitoring and surveillance of security-significant events
- Certificate management via PKI services
- User registration and authentication with two-factor authentication
- RBAC model for access control
- HTTPS communication and encryption of sensitive data
- Single Sign-On
